limit number of steps due to size of train cards (8 lines??)

Add a notes field to the train information for printing on the cards


add a list of cancelled/skipped trains

add a watchdog - if we do not receive enough clock messages within a certain timeframe, reset the connection.  Also, should watch for other error types
